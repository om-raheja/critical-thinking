# critical-thinking

On August 25, 2024 I finished reading "The Thinker's Toolkit" by Morgan D. Jones. 

Little did I realize it when I finished the book, but the techniques I learned and practiced while reading the book were so powerful that I ended up using them all the time.

All. The. Time.

Critical thinking and problem solving is a **very powerful** skill. Unfortunately, it is not taught to us.

If you want to use some of the tools he taught us about, you can use my software to make it easier to understand and use. Especially laborious processes like ranking.
